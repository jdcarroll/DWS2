	    	<h3>This Months Showcased Program</h3>
			<p>Through the X- Factor at Nextlvlsports many have found the extra-gear needed through explosive power & increased agility more than ever. Many of today's players are missing the X-Factor they see in the athletes at the next level. In most sports the athlete with the most speed & explosiveness win due to superior athleticism. At Next Level we understand that knowing how to play, dealing with failure properly and being fundamentally sound makes the difference. However, explosiveness, speed & endurance are critical in competition. NLS players once again, are separating themselves from the competition by working on the ever elusive X-Factor! </p>

			<p>All sessions are HIGH INTENSITY based, coupled with short stations to maximize explosive movements, muscle confusion and stamina. Good cardio will be required to keep up, but explosive movements are demanded throughout each session. These sessions are a blast but players are pushed to their limit. The only question is... are you ready to take your body to the next level?   </p>
